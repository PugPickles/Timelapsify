# Timelapsify

### Tested with Canon EOS cameras, may be that for other cameras things must be changed

## Note

In my case it is important to connect GND, otherwise the triggering will not work.

The pins for the connector do not have to be the same, test best with a cable which pin is for what (And check if the pins to trigger and detect (manual release) are high (3.3V))


## Use

* Connect ESP with power
* Use the app (automatically connects to wifi and displays website in webview)

or

* Connect to the wifi ```Timelapsify``` with pass ```g3t_th3_fuck_out```
* Call the page ```http://192.168.1.1``` in the browser

The Android app is quick and dirty, so is a bit buggy


## ToDo
* App > Detect when wifi was disconnected
